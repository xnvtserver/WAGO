Excellent — got it. You’re a software company pitching **website + domain/hosting + booking app** for “Garrage — SixtyOne” (and likely other garages). I’ll act as a senior sales lead who understands the full funnel and pain points from lead generation through onboarding and expansion. Below is a practical, step-by-step sales strategy plus all the associated particulars (packages, pricing guidance, outreach scripts, objection handling, KPIs, tools, onboarding checklist, contracts/SLA pointers, and upsell playbook). Use it as a playbook your sales & delivery teams can run immediately.

# 1 — Sales strategy overview (big picture)

Goal: win small-to-medium local garage customers for recurring revenue (hosting + maintenance + booking app + optional ongoing marketing).
Approach: Target local multi-bay garages and chains → demonstrate immediate ROI (more bookings, fewer no-shows, better parts ordering) → sell a clear bundle (Website + Hosting + Booking MVP) → convert to subscription & upsell (SMS reminders, analytics, paid ads).

# 2 — Target customer profiles (personas)

1. Owner-Operator (Age 35–55) — single location, values simplicity, low tech tolerance, cares about cost and footfall.
2. Multi-site Owner / Small Chain — 2–10 shops, wants central booking, reporting, inventory hints.
3. Service Manager (decision influencer) — wants daily schedule control, fewer no-shows, parts ETA.

# 3 — Core pain points you must address

* No reliable online presence / no Google visibility.
* Manual booking (calls, WhatsApp) → double bookings, missed calls, no tracking.
* No-shows & inefficient time utilization.
* Lack of simple invoicing / receipts and repeat-customer growth.
* Difficulty in managing spare-parts ETA and communicating it to customers.
* Fear of complexity and monthly costs.

# 4 — Product & offering (packages + deliverables)

Offer 3 standardized packages + add-ons for clarity and faster closes.

Basic (Website Starter + Hosting)

* Deliverables: 5-page responsive website (Home, Services, About, Contact, Booking page), Google My Business setup checklist, domain registration help, 1 year shared hosting, basic SEO (NAP), contact form.

* Deliverables: Everything in Basic + lightweight booking system (web + admin dashboard) with time slots, service types, SMS/WhatsApp confirmation, basic calendar sync (Google Calendar), admin/reservation manager.
* Price (indicative): ₹75,000–1,75,000 one-time (MVP) + ₹8,000–18,000/year subscription (hosting, SMS credits, maintenance).

Premium (Franchise / Multi-site + App)

* Deliverables: Custom website + booking web app + Android app (or PWA) for customers + admin multi-location dashboard + reports (bookings, revenue, retention) + API for payments + priority support. Optional inventory/parts module.

* Final: Remaining 20% on production/live.
* Recurring: Monthly/annual hosting+support subscription invoiced upfront (prefer annual discount).
* Offer 3 & 12-month support packs; discount for annual commitment (e.g., 10–15% for 1-year prepay).

# 6 — Sales funnel & KPI targets

Funnel stages: Prospect → MQL (contacted) → SQL (booked demo) → Proposal → PO/Contract → Delivery → Live → Retention/Upgrade.

Key KPIs (initial targets)

* Lead response time: <4 hours (phone/WhatsApp ideal).
* Demo booking rate from contacted leads: 30%+.
* Proposal win rate: 25% (reasonable starting).
* Time from lead → signed: 7–21 days (depends on decision-maker).
* Churn (year 1): aim <20% for hosted customers with good SLA.
* Average revenue per customer (ARR): depends on package — aim for ₹30k–2L yearly.

# 7 — Lead generation channels & tactics

A. Local outreach (highest ROI)

* Google My Business outreach: Target garages not claiming GMB.
* Door-to-door sales / field visits with a printed one-pager & demo tablet.
* Local auto-parts wholesalers, tyre shops — partnership/referrals.
* Repair unions / associations announcements.

B. Digital

* Facebook & Instagram ads targeted by pin-code and ‘garage owner’ interests.
* Local SEO (target “garage near me”, “car service in <town>”).
* WhatsApp broadcast to local lists + follow-up sequence.
* Google Ads (call-only and local intent).

C. Inbound

* Case studies + short explainer videos: “How booking cut no-shows by 30% for a local garage.”
* Landing pages optimized for conversion and local keywords.
* Free 14-day trial or free setup for first X customers.

D. Partnerships

* Vehicle spares distributors, fleet managers, insurance agents, taxi services.

# 8 — Outreach & follow-up playbook (scripts & templates)

Use these—short, local, benefit-led.

Cold SMS / WhatsApp (short)

```
Hi [Name], this is [YourName] from [YourCo]. We help garages get 10–30 new bookings/month using a simple booking page + SMS reminders. Can I show you a 7-minute demo tomorrow? — [Phone]
```

Cold Call opener (30–60s)

```
Hi [Name], I’m [Name] at [YourCo]. Quick question — how do customers currently book service at [Garage]? (Pause) We built a simple booking page + SMS reminders that reduced no-shows for garages like yours. If I show a 7-minute demo, can we explore whether this helps you get more confirmed bookings?
```

Demo structure (20 minutes)

1. 60s intro + pain confirmation: “You told me X, Y, Z?”
2. 6 minutes: live demo — booking flow from customer POV.
3. 6 minutes: admin flow + calendar + SMS reminder.
4. 4 minutes: pricing, timeline, next steps + close (“If you sign today we’ll include one month free SMS”)

Proposal email structure (short)

* Subject: Proposal — Website + Booking for [Garage]
* One-line summary: deliverables, price, timeline.
* ROI statement: e.g., “Expected to reduce no-shows by 20–30% and increase confirmed bookings by X.”
* CTA: “Sign PO or reply with a time to review.”

# 9 — Objection handling (common objections + responses)

1. “Too expensive / No budget”
   — “I hear you. Many owners recoup the setup cost within 2–3 months from just 2–3 extra bookings per week. We can start with the Basic package and enable booking later.”

2. “We already use WhatsApp”
   — “WhatsApp is great — our booking page can integrate with WhatsApp confirmations, but gives you a calendar, reduces manual messages, and logs history for billing.”

3. “I’m not tech savvy”
   — “We do the setup, training (15–30 minutes), and provide local language one-page manual. Day-one support is included.”

4. “Will customers use it?”
   — “Customers prefer online booking for convenience. We’ll show you how to promote it in-shop (QR poster + SMS) and add a Google Bookings link.”

5. “What if system fails?”
   — “We keep 99.9% uptime on our hosting plans and a telephone support channel; critical issues get a response SLA of 4 hours (or upgrade to 1-hour priority).”

# 10 — Sales collateral & assets to prepare (checklist)

* One-page sales deck (Benefits + pricing + 3 case examples).
* Demo environment (playable sample booking site).
* Localized poster / QR code PDF to give customers.
* Proposal template + T&C + SLA template.
* Short explainer video (60–90s).
* Testimonials (get pilots early).

# 11 — CRM & tracking (fields & process)

Use a CRM (HubSpot / Zoho / Pipedrive). Key fields:

* Garage name, owner, phone, pin-code, number of bays, monthly revenue estimate, decision timeframe, lead source, last contact date, demo date, proposal sent date, expected close date, package interested, contracted (Y/N).

Automation:

* Auto follow-up sequence via email/WhatsApp after demo (1-3 day, 7-day, 14-day).
* Use call logging and set tasks for next action.

# 12 — Delivery & onboarding checklist (what to do after close)

Pre-launch (week 0)
