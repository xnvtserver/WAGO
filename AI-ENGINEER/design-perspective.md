âš¡ Data Flow Architecture

Database Layer (Knex + PostgreSQL/MySQL)

users (roles: student, faculty, staff, admin)

courses, assignments, messages, tickets, events, analytics

Backend (Node.js/Express)

APIs for authentication, CRUD, analytics generation.

AI assistant logic â†’ powered by stored analytics.

Frontend (Vue/React)

Separate dashboards for each role (studentDashboard, facultyDashboard, etc.).

API calls populate widgets dynamically.

Real-time Layer (WebSockets)

Messaging, notifications, live updates.

ðŸ‘‰ So basically:

Students learn + interact.

Faculty teach + track.

Staff manage + support.

Admin oversees + governs.
